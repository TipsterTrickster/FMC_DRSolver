This works kinda like mallard except there is no RZP step, it is much slower, it uses NISSY, but it saves ALL the EOs, DRs, and final solutions to a csv file


you need to change the nissy_path variable to the path to the directory where the nissy executable is
you also may need to change the nissy_filename variable to the name of the nissy executable file


Put 0 in preset to set own limits

preset 1:
5 Move EOs with NISS
11 move DRs with NISS
21 move solutions

preset 2
5 Move EOs with NISS
12 move liner DRs (no switching during DR)
22 move solutions


One issue I have been too lazy to fix is filtering out redundant solutions (IE contains R' R2 or smth)
